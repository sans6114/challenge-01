## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a dynamic product listing application that includes a functional shopping cart. It is designed to provide users with an interactive experience where they can:

-Add and remove items from the cart.

-Adjust the quantity of items in the cart.

-View a confirmation modal upon confirming their order.

-Reset their selections to start a new order.

-Enjoy a responsive interface optimized for different screen sizes.

The project leverages a local data.json file to populate the product list dynamically and ensures a smooth user experience through clean and efficient design practices. The focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and functional UI.
